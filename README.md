# Slack Export Prettify
A super simple proof of concept client-side only SPA that takes Slack Exports
(zip) and displays them in a human readable format in the browser

# How to use it?

Just visit https://ckelner.github.io/slack-export-prettify/ and follow the
instructions.

# Why?

Some friends in one of my Slack team's wanted to preserve the history of our
channels but also have a human friendly way to view them at a future date,
thus was born this project.
